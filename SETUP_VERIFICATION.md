## ✅ Code Fixes Applied

### Issue Fixed: Missing Mobility Exports
**Error**: `The requested module '/src/lib/nasa/mobility.js' does not provide an export named 'analyzePublicTransitImpact'`

**Solution**: Added 6 missing functions to `mobility.js`:

1. ✅ `calculateMobilityRisk(location, bbox)` - Overall mobility risk scoring
2. ✅ `analyzeTrafficPatterns(bbox)` - Traffic hotspots and forecast
3. ✅ `optimizeEvacuationRoutes(location, bbox)` - Emergency route planning
4. ✅ `analyzePublicTransitImpact(location, bbox)` - Transit disruption analysis
5. ✅ `calculateAccessibility(location)` - Accessibility scoring
6. ✅ `predictTrafficCongestion(location, timeframe)` - 24-hour predictions

**Total Functions Added**: 200+ lines of code

## 🎯 Error Resolution

### Browser Console Errors (Before)
```
❌ Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/lib/nasa/mobility.js' 
   does not provide an export named 'analyzePublicTransitImpact'
```

### Browser Console (Now)
```
✅ No critical errors
⚠️ CSS linting warnings (Tailwind - normal, can be ignored)
ℹ️  Extension messages (browser extensions - ignore)
```

### CSS Warnings (Safe to Ignore)
```
@tailwind base;       ← Tailwind directive (works fine)
@tailwind components; ← Tailwind directive (works fine)
@tailwind utilities;  ← Tailwind directive (works fine)
```

These are CSS linter warnings that don't affect functionality. Tailwind processes them correctly.
