## 🔌 Backend Integration (When Ready)

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable
```bash
# In .env or .env.local
VITE_HYFUSE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

### Step 2: Update API Client
In `src/lib/nasa/hyfuse.js`:
1. Uncomment the `fetch()` calls
2. Comment out the mock data returns
3. Test with your backend

### Step 3: Use the Prompts
Copy the 3 detailed prompts from `WATER_FLOOD_API.md`:
1. **OpenAPI Spec** - Paste into LLM to generate API contract
2. **FastAPI Service** - Get complete backend code
3. **Database & Docker** - Get deployment setup

Each prompt is optimized for LLMs and includes:
- Clear requirements
- Expected outputs
- Implementation details
- Testing instructions

## 📊 Technical Details

### HyFuse Score Algorithm
```javascript
// Weighted combination of 4 NASA data sources
score = 0.4 × rainfall_zscore +
        0.3 × soil_moisture_zscore +
        0.15 × grace_anomaly_zscore +
        0.15 × inundation_count_zscore

// Normalized to 0-100 scale
final_score = rescale(score, 0, 100)

// Confidence based on data completeness
confidence = available_components / 4
```

### Data Sources (Backend)
- **Rainfall**: GPM IMERG (NASA)
- **Soil Moisture**: SMAP L3 (NASA)
- **GRACE**: GRACE-FO gravity anomalies (NASA/GFZ)
- **Inundation**: Sentinel-1 SAR (ESA/Copernicus)

### State Management
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Prop drilling for shared state
- Callback handlers for parent updates
- Local storage for persistent settings

---

## 🎓 Architecture Decisions

### Why Tabs?
- Separates concerns (scores vs floods vs packs vs alerts)
- Reduces cognitive load
- Easy to add more features later
- Familiar UX pattern

### Why Mock Data?
- Frontend development without backend
- Fast iteration and testing
- Demo-ready immediately
- Easy to switch to real API

### Why These Components?
Based on your requirements:
- **HyFuse**: Core risk assessment (LLM prompt requirement)
- **Flood Masks**: SAR-derived overlays (prompt requirement)
- **Field Packs**: Automated reports (prompt requirement)
- **Alerts**: Proactive monitoring (prompt requirement)
