## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Pattern
```javascript
// Each panel follows this structure:
UrbanInfrastructurePanel/
├── State: activeTab, loading, error
├── Effects: Data fetching on location change
├── Mock Generators: Location-based calculations
├── Tab Navigation: 6 clickable tabs
├── Tab Content: Switch statement rendering
└── Visualizations: Progress bars, metrics, zones
```

### Data Flow
```
App.jsx (fetches weather, airQuality, disasters)
   ↓
   Passes props: { location, bbox, cityName, airQuality }
   ↓
Panel Component (generates mock data from location)
   ↓
   Displays in 6 tabs with visualizations
   ↓
User toggles panels via Header checkboxes
```

### Mock Data Strategy
All panels use intelligent mock data generators:
- Calculate realistic values based on location coordinates
- Use climate zones for context-appropriate estimates
- Include comments showing where to integrate real APIs
- Provide consistent, deterministic results for testing

### Ready for Real Integration
API integration points marked with comments:
```javascript
// TODO: Replace with real Census Bureau API
// TODO: Replace with real EPA AirNow API
// TODO: Replace with real USGS Water Services API
// TODO: Replace with real EIA Energy API
```
