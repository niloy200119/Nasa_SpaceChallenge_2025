## Quick Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Check City Resilience
1. Search for your city
2. Enable "Resilience" checkbox
3. View your city's score
4. Read recommendations
5. Compare component scores

**Expected Result**: See 0-100 score with breakdown and action items

### Test 2: Simulate a Flood
1. Enable "Scenarios" checkbox
2. Select "Floods"
3. Set severity to "High"
4. Set duration to 24 hours
5. Click "Run Simulation"
6. Press Play to watch timeline

**Expected Result**: See water depth, drainage capacity, evacuation windows changing over 24 hours

### Test 3: Compare Disasters
1. Run flood scenario (as above)
2. Note the aspects shown (water depth, drainage, etc.)
3. Change disaster type to "Wildfires"
4. Run simulation again
5. Note completely different aspects (fire spread, smoke, wind)

**Expected Result**: Each disaster shows unique, relevant aspects

### Test 4: Multi-City Comparison
1. Search "Miami" → Check resilience score
2. Search "Seattle" → Check resilience score
3. Search "Phoenix" → Check resilience score
4. Compare scores and vulnerabilities

**Expected Result**: Different scores based on each city's specific risks
